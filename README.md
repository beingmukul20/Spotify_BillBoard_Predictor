# Spotify_BillBoard_Predictor

In this study, we approached the Hit Song Science problem, aiming to predict which songs will become Billboard Hot 100 hits. We collated a dataset of approximately 4,000 hit and non-hit songs and extracted each songs audio features from the Spotify Web API. We were able to predict the Billboard success of a song with approximately 75% accuracy on the validation set, using five machine-learning algorithms. 

The most successful algorithms were Logistic Regression and a Neural Network with one hidden layer.
